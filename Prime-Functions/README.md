#Prime-Functions

##Overview

Contains a variety of number functions surrounding prime numbers. Main file is just used to run basic tests to ensure correctness.
Functions can be used through: #include "Prime_Functions.h". Detailed explanations of each function can be found within header.
Brief overview of functions is given below.

##Functions

1. bool isPrime(int num)
  * Returns true if num is a prime number
  * Note: Can make this far more efficient -> See AKS Primality Test
2. int nPrimeNumber(int n)
  * Returns the nth prime number on the number line
3. void largestPrimeFactor(void)
  * Outputs the largest prime factor of a number input by user
4. unsigned long long summationOfPrimes(int n)
  * Returns the sum of all primes below n
