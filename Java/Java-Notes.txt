Java Notes

Compiling: javac HelloWorld.java

Javac is the compiler program.

Compiler creates HelloWorld.class -> This is the executable file

Run: java HelloWorld

This will run the executable .class file through using the java interpreter.

Any public class can be used by any package

Non-public class can only be used within it's own package

In C++, when you declare an array, storage for the array is allocated. In Java, when you declare an array, you are really only declaring a pointer to an array; storage for the array itself is not allocated until you use "new":
           C++                              

int A[10];  // A is an array of length 10	    
A[0] = 5;   // set the 1st element of array A
                                    

          JAVA

int [] A;          // A is a pointer to an array
A = new int [10];  // now A points to an array of length 10
A[0] = 5;          // set the 1st element of the array pointed to by A

Create main function at the end after all other functions have been created.

Commenting is the same syntax

Need to allocate memory for arrays. Remember to use new if you want to allocate during runtime i.e. Size of array is unknown during compile time.
