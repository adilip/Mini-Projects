#Mini-Projects

##Overview

These are just some simple programs in C++ to keep my programming skills up.
The following is a list of the programs and a brief description, the READMEs in their respective directories are more detailed.

1. 8-Queens
  * Attempts to solve the 8-Queens problem in chess.
  * Tries to find a solution of placing 8 Queens in a chessboard without any queens being able to attack the others.
  * UPDATE: Only solves for 7 queens. Need to implement B&B and backtracking algorithms to solve for 8-Queens.
2. Coin Sums
  * Provides the number of different ways of forming a total in pounds using British coins.
  * Possible British coins are: 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, 1 pound, 2 pounds.
3. First Days
  * Returns the number of times a certain day occurs on the 1st of a month between the start and end years.
  * Note: Start year must be after 1900.
4. Intercept-Shield
  * Missile defence program simulation. Takes into account safe zone, incoming rocket and defensive patriot battery information.
  * Outputs the ID of a patriot battery and direction of fire to intercept rocket.
  * If unable to intercept, will output a warning message and coordinates of entry into safe zone.
5. Largest-Product-Functions
  * Various functions targetting large products.
  * Covers some project-euler problems.
6. Prime-Functions
  * Various functions that circulate around primes.
  * Covers some project-euler problems.
7. Special-Unique-Number-Functions
  * Various number functions that don't fit into other categories.
  * Covers some project-euler problems.
8. Sudoku_Solver
  * Solves sudokus. Takes in a sudoku problem and outputs the solution.
9. Summation-Functions
  * Various number functions that focus on summations
  * Covers some project-euler problems.
